# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Project Description

In this project, Iâ€™m developing the foundation of an interactive image-sharing site called Spots.

The main focus is on:

Responsive design: ensuring the webpage adapts smoothly to various screen sizes using CSS Grid, media queries, and other modern techniques.

Modals: implementing interactive pop-up windows that allow users to edit their profile, add new content, and interact with the site in a dynamic way.

Form validation: adding custom JavaScript validation for forms inside the modals. Each form step (separated into fieldsets) is validated independently, with real-time feedback for users and proper enabling/disabling of submit buttons.

This combination creates a smooth, user-friendly experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices while laying the groundwork for a more fully-featured interactive platform.

Features

ðŸ“± Responsive Layout â€“ built with CSS Grid and media queries for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

ðŸªŸ Interactive Modals â€“ profile editing, content addition, and dynamic interactions in popup windows.

âœ… Form Validation â€“ custom JavaScript validation with error messages, red borders, and per-fieldset validation.

â›” Button State Management â€“ submit buttons are automatically enabled/disabled based on input validity.

ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI â€“ clean and adaptable design that provides a seamless user experience.
